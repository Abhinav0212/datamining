K Nearest Neighbor
==================

This is a program to implement a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classification algorithm and test this method on both the Iris and Income datasets.

Instruction to run the code
---------------------------
The instruction to run the python files are provided below.
distance_measure = 1 : Euclidean Similarity
distance_measure = 2 : Cosine Similarity

For Iris data set:
    1. Command : python knnIris.py <training_file> <testing_file> <distance_measure> [<value_of_k>]
    eg:          python knnIris.py data/Iris.csv data/Iris_Test.csv 1 5
    2. If distance_measure = 1, the output will be written to the file Iris_euclid_output.csv
    3. If distance_measure = 2, the output will be written to the file Iris_cosine_output.csv

For Income data set:
    1. Command : python knnIncome.py <training_file> <testing_file> <distance_measure> [<value_of_k>]
    eg:          python knnIncome.py data/Income.csv data/Income_Test.csv 1 5
    2. If distance_measure = 1, the output will be written to the file Income_euclid_output.csv
    3. If distance_measure = 2, the output will be written to the file Income_cosine_output.csv

Output format
-------------

The output is an n-by-4 dataset, where n is the number of examples in the test dataset.

Transaction ID      Actual Class        Predicted Class         Posterior Probability

The Actual Class is the class of the record that is listed in the test file.
Predicted Class is the prediction that is made based on the kNN algorithm and training dataset.
Posterior Probability is the probability that the record belongs to the predicted class, based on the output of the kNN algorithm.
