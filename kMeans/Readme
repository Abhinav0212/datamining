K Means Clustering
==================

This is a program to implement a K-Means clustering algorithm and test this method on sample two dimensional data and the wine quality dataset.

Instruction to run the code
---------------------------
The instruction to run the python files are provided below.

Command : python kMeans.py <file_name> [<value_of_k>]
eg:       python kMeans.py data/TwoDimEasy.csv 2

where k is the number of clusters.

Output format
-------------

The output is an n-by-2 dataset, where n is the number of examples in the test dataset.

Row ID      Predicted Cluster

Predicted Cluster is the prediction that is made based on the KMeans algorithm.
