    python gaussian.py <train_file> <test_file>
    eg: python gaussian.py train.txt test.txt

For the classifier with mixture of gaussians per vowel
    python mixtureOfGaussian.py <train_file> <test_file> <num_of_mixtures>
    eg: python mixtureOfGaussian.py train.txt test.txt 3

The output (predicted classes) will be written to output.txt
